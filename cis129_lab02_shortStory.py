print(' On a clear sunny day, me and my family decided to go to the park and enjoy the beatiful day.
At the park me and my family had a picnic and played soccer all day long. Once it got dark, we headed back home and had some
ice cream we picked up on our way home. It was a wonderful day and I hope to do it again. ')
